            <p>50 percent of the red onions in Kenya are imported from Tanzania, as 
			indicated by Food and Agriculture Organisation's (FAO) 2014 report. 
			Kenyan Farmers have been doing their best to address the demand and close the gap, 
			but there is still more supply to be achieved. This makes the Red Bulb Onion
			a very attractive commercial investment for the Kenyan market at the moment, since local production is not enough.</p>
			
            <p>Major types of onions farmed in Kenya are bulb onions and spring onions. 
			The best areas suited for farming being Karatina, Oloitoktok, Naivasha, Kieni, Emali and Mai Mahiu </p>
			
			<p> Bulb onions take 3 to 4 months to reach maturity. Short rains are great for bulb onions since 
			they can be harvested between January and February. Local farmers are able to benefit during this time period,
			since there is low supply of onions from Tanzania at this time of the year. After the long rains of March, 
			the price of these onions hike and farmers who harvest after these period make good profit margins. </p>
			
			<p>Our recent market analysis, shows red onion prices in Mombasa are going at Ksh 1,174 per 15 kg bag while 
			the highest prices are in Eldoret, at Ksh 1,491 per 15 kg bag. Heavy rains experienced in the months of May and June
			in these areas have contributed to the price hikes. </p>
			
			<p>Spring onions are easy to plant. You can even plant them at your kitchen garden. 
			They are commonly used in vegetable salads or as seasoning in soups. 
			Some of the health benefits of spring onions include lower blood sugar and decreasing blood pressure and cholesterol levels. </p>
			
			<p>Of the two types, bulb onions are more popular than the spring ones due to their long shelf life and sweet taste.
			Currently, there are two different varieties of bulb onions in the market. There is the small, thin and firmly
			layered onion that has a strong pungent smell from Tanzania. The second one is the big loosely held variety that 
			is grown locally, in Kenya. </p>
			
			<p><strong>Conditions for Onion Farming </strong><br>

						Onions perform well in well drained, fertile, sandy loam, non-compacted soils.
						The ideal pH is 5.8 to 6.8. Onion farming is a worthy venture since it’s possible to
						grow onions throughout the year via irrigation. Soil test with accredited laboratories is advised. </p>

					<p>	The ideal temperatures onions need to grow are between 13 – 35 degrees centigrade. 
						This means that onions can grow in most parts of Kenya. However, to maximize production in areas 
						such as Ukambani and some parts in the Coastal area, one needs to invest in a greenhouse and drip irrigation.
						This is because greenhouses will optimize the temperatures since these areas are hot and irrigation will 
						provide the much needed water. Onions are a cool season crop. Most areas in Ukambani and the Coastal region are extremely dry.</p>

					<p>	In terms of requirements, apart from land that is an obvious fact, other requirements are DAP Fertilizer and seedlings.
						1 kg of seedlings can be used in 1 acre while 20 grams of DAP Fertilizer is applied per square meter.<br>

						You should note that there are different seed varieties and they perform differently under different conditions.
						Common hybrid varieties available in Kenya include Red Creole, Red Pinnoy, Jambar 1 and Red Bombay.
						The most popular seed variety in Kenya is the Jambar F1 since it produces high yield and the size of its onions are bigger.</p>

					<p>	<strong>Challenges facing Onion Farming in Kenya</strong> <br><br>

						<strong> <i>Rains or Excess Watering:</i></strong> Too much rains or excess watering can water log the crop. 
						If the rain in your area is too much, focus on growing the crop during the short rains. 
						You can also raise the beds to ensure the water flows out of the field. Avoid excessive watering of your onions.
						The best type of irrigation on onions is drip irrigation. Overhead irrigation should be avoided as it causes fungal diseases.<br><br>

						<strong> <i>Diseases:</i></strong>  Common diseases that affect onions include Downy Mildew, Bacterial Soft Rots, Pink/White Root,
						Botrytis, and Rusts. Use herbicides to get rid of the diseases.<br><br>

						<strong> <i>Pests: </i></strong> Common pests that attack onions include maggots, thrips, nematodes and the leaf miner.
						Use pesticides from accredited brands to get rid of the pests.<br><br>

						<strong> <i>Weeds:</i> </strong> Weeds can also destroy your crop and should be removed occasionally either physically or 
						through the use of herbicides. In one season, there should be at least 2 – 3 weeding sessions. <br><br>

						<strong>Harvesting onions.</strong> <br><br>

						The best time to do the harvesting is during the dry season. Keep a calendar and record the essential dates to ensure you
						harvest at the right time. Bulb onions are ready for harvesting once they form a shiny membranous cover around the bulbs
						or when the foliage withers. Spring onions are ready for harvesting when they are 15 centimeters tall and 1.5 centimeters thick.<br>

						Harvesting is done by pulling the bulbs and then chopping off the leaves. You then dry the bulbs in the sun before storing the produce.<br><br>

						Nairobi is experiencing the lowest prices at the moment at 825 kshs per 15 kg bag. This can be attributed to Nairobi being 
						the capital city and many farmers who produce the vegetable are in areas closely bordering it, such as Karatina, Mai Mahiu, Emali 
						and Kieni having easy access to the market. Get more market analysis from our Price trends to always get updated on the Onion trends. </p> <br>

								It's the warm season. Farmers are happy that their tomatoes are finally going to receive the much 
								sunlight needed for the fruit to grow bigger, juicier and firmer. What most probably don't know is 
								that with the warm weather sets in the most dreaded disease. 
								The monster that can wipe a farmer's field clean :<strong> Bacteria Wilt.</strong> <br> <br>

								Bacteria Wilt is caused by the pathogen bacterium Ralstonia Solanacearum and is quite 
								common in the moist & humid sandy soils. This bacterium lives in the soil and will work 
								its way quickly through the roots and up the stem of the plants. 
								It's spread by contaminated equipment, soil, water and infected plant material. <br> <br>

								<strong>Symptoms</strong> <br>

								The first symptoms of the disease is wilting of the youngest lower leaves of the plant
								and eventually the entire plant dies without any leaf spotting or yellowing. 
								These symptoms usually occur when the weather is hot, the humidity is high or the soil is wet.
								It is also common with soils that have high pH. <br> <br>

								<strong>The glass test.</strong> <br>

								You can test for bacterial wilt by cutting the stem at the base of the plant. 
								Look for discolored tissue. Suspend the stem in a glass of water.
								If it is infected, a white, slimy substance will ooze into the water.<br><br>

								<strong>Treatment & Control</strong> <br>

								There are no known chemicals to effectively control this disease. 
								it is a good recommendation that planting resistant varieties is probably the best solution so far.

								So how do I prevent Bacterial Wilt asks the farmer? Follow these good cultural controls says M-Farm:<br>
								

									~ Test your soil for bacterial wilt before planting. There are several institutions that
									Ensure to also test for pH and maintain a pH of 6.2-6.5 <br>

									~ Rotate your crops regularly <br>

									~ If any of your crops is affected, uproot them.<br> 

									~ Growing the plants off the ground in bags is recommended. The bags should not 
									directly sit on the ground to avoid any contact with the soil.
									If not planting in bags or pots,try raised beds to improve drainage as running water spreads the disease fast<br>

									~ Space plants far enough apart to provide good air circulation.<br>

									~ Wash your hands after handling infected plants and sterilizes any gardening tool 
									that could have been used in infected soil.<br>
								


								With these few tips and tricks, we wish all the best in maintaining a disease free farm. </p><br>

			<p> Soil health has been defined as the "the continued capacity of soil to function as a vital living system,
						within ecosystem and land-use boundaries, to sustain biological productivity, 
						promote the quality of air and water environments, and maintain plant, animal, 
						and human health" (Pankhurst et al., 1997). <br> <br>

						Two elements in this definition of soil health distinguish it from the definition of soil quality: <br>
						(i) the inclusion of a time component (e.g. ''the continued capacity of'' - reflecting the 
						importance of the soil in being able to continue to function over time); and 
						(ii) recognition of soil "as a vital living system" (emphasizing the importance of the soil biota to soil functioning).<br> <br>

						Building on this definition of Pankhurst and co-authors, members of an international workshop at FAO,
						have come up with this definition:
						"Soil health is the capacity of soil to function as a living system, with ecosystem and land use boundaries,
						to sustain plant and animal productivity, maintain or enhance water and air quality, and promote plant and
						animal health. Healthy soils maintain a diverse community of soil organisms that help to control plant disease, 
						insect and weed pests, form beneficial symbiotic associations with plant roots; recycle essential plant nutrients;
						improve soil structure with positive repercussions for soil water and nutrient holding capacity,
						and ultimately improve crop production" (FAO, 2008). To this definition one might want to add an
						ecosystem perspective:  A healthy soil does not pollute its environment and does contribute
						to mitigating climate change by maintaining or increasing its carbon content.<br> <br>

						The concept of soil health captures the ecological attributes of the soil, 
						which have implications beyond its quality or capacity to produce a particular crop. 
						These attributes are chiefly those associated with the soil biota; its biodiversity,
						its food web structure, its activity and the range of functions it performs. For example, 
						soil biodiversity is not necessarily a soil property that is critical 
						for the production of a given crop, but it is a property that may be important for 
						the continued capacity of the soil to produce that crop.</p> <br>

							With increasing population, urbanization and contagious depletion of natural resources, there has to 
							be a paradigm shift in farmer’s perception from production to productivity and to profitability. 
							In this present scenario, the major challenge arising are shrinking land and depleting water and other
							related resources in agriculture.<br>

							There is need for promoting farmer friendly location specific production system management technologies
							in a concerted manner to achieve vertical growth in horticulture production dully ensuring quality of 
							produce and better remuneration per unit of area with judicious use of natural resources.<br>

							In this endeavor, precision farming aims to have efficient utilization of resources per unit of time 
							and area for achieving targeted production of horticultural produce.<br><br>

							<strong>What is precision farming?</strong><br>

							Precision farming is a comprehensive information based farm management system to identify, analyze and
							manage variability within fields for optimum profitability, sustainability and protection of land resources.<br>

							In other words, we can say that, it is an efficient management of resources through location specific high 
							tech interventions which includes fertilization, protected/ greenhouse cultivation, soil and leaf nutrient
							based fertilizer management, mulching for in-situ moisture conservation, micro-propagation, high density 
							planting, drip irrigation etc.<br>

							Precision farming integrates environmental health, economic profitability and social and economic equity by
							giving emphasis on crop management using technologies like geographic information system (GIS),
							Global Positioning System (GPS), remote sensing (RS) along with ground equipment like variable rate applicators (VRA),
							yield monitors and computers along with appropriate software.<br>

							Many technological developments including Information and communications technology and Geo-informatics led
							to the development of the concept of precision farming. Its success relies on the integration of these 
							technologies into a single system that can be operated at farm level with sustainable effort. These technological
							developments are as follows:<br><br>

							<strong><i>Geo-informatics</i></strong><br>

							Geo-informatics is a term that appears to have been independently coined by several groups around the world to
							describe a variety of efforts to promote collaboration between computer science and the geosciences to solve 
							complex scientific questions. It is the science and technology of gathering, analyzing, interpreting, distributing
							and using geographic information.<br>

							Geo-informatics otherwise called as geomatics encompasses a broad range of disciplines including surveying 
							and mapping, RS, GIS, and the GPS.<br><br>

							<strong><i>GPS</i></strong><br>

							The GPS is a satellite-based navigation system that can be used to locate positions anywhere on the earth. 
							GPS provides continuous (24 hours/day), real-time, three-dimensional positioning, navigation and timing 
							worldwide in any weather condition.<br>

							GPS was originally intended for military applications, but in the 1980s, the government made the system 
							available for civilian use. There are no subscription fees or setup charges to use GPS. Any person with a
							GPS receiver can access the system, and it can be used for any application that requires location coordinates.<br>

							The development of the publicly available global positioning system (GPS) has opened new doors in opportunities
							for spatial data. More recently farmers have gained access to site specific technology though GPS which is 
							used for yield mapping and variable rate fertilizer/pesticide applicator.<br><br>
							
							<strong> <i>RS Technique</i></strong><br>

							RS is the science of making inferences about material objects from measurements, made at distance, without coming
							into physical contact with the objects under study.<br>

							The RS system consists of a sensor to collect the radiation and a platform — an aircraft, balloon, rocket, 
							satellite or even a ground-based sensor-supporting stand — on which a sensor can be mounted.<br>

							Currently a number of aircraft and spacecraft imaging systems are operating using remote sensing sensors. Some of 
							the current image systems from spacecraft platform include Indian Remote Sensing Satellites (IRS), French National 
							Earth Observation Satellite (SPOT), IKONOS, a commercial Earth observation satellite, etc.<br><br>

							<strong><i>GIS</i></strong><br>

							The GIS is a computerized data storage and retrieval system, which can be used to manage and analyze spatial 
							data relating crop productivity and agronomic factors. It can integrate all types of information and interface 
							with other decision support tools.<br>

							GIS can display analyzed information in maps that allow better understanding of interactions among yield, fertility,
							pests, weeds and other factors, and decision-making based on such spatial relationships.<br><br>

								~ Many types of GIS software with varying functionality and price are now available. Many farm 
								information systems (FIS) are available, which use simple programs to create a farm level database.<br>
							<br>	

							One example of such FIS is local resources information system, which consists of several modules and enables data import;
							generation of raster files (or bitmap image) by different gridding methods; the storage of raster information in a database;
							the generation of digital agro-resource maps; the creation of operational maps, etc.<br>

							GIS is useful to create fertility, weed and pest intensity maps, which can then be used for making maps that show 
							recommended application rates of nutrients or pesticides.<br><br>

							<strong>Other Technologies</strong><br><br>
							<strong><i>Computer and Internet</i></strong><br>

							The computers and Internet are the most important component in enabling the precision farming possible as they are main
							source of information processing and gathering. The high-speed computer has made faster processing the data gathered 
							during precise management of the land parcel.<br>

							Internet, which is a network of computers, is the most recent development among all these technologies. The Internet has 
							bridged the gap between the information provider and the user. In agriculture, like any other form of business, internet
							has the capability to supply timely data about changing conditions.<br><br>

							<strong><i>Spatial Decision Support Systems (SDSS)</i></strong><br>

							SDSS are designed to help growers to solve complex spatial problems and to make decision concerning to irrigation scheduling,
							fertilisation, use of crop growth regulators and other chemicals.<br>

							Spatial decision support systems have evolved in parallel with decision support systems. In addition, in order to effectively
							support decision-making for complex spatial problems, a SDSS will need to:<br>

								~ provide for spatial data input<br>
								~ allow storage of complex structures common in spatial data<br>
								~ include analytical techniques that are unique to spatial analysis<br>
								~ provide output in the form of maps and other spatial forms<br><br>	
							
							<strong><i>Yield Mapping</i></strong><br>

							Yield mapping and soil sampling tend to be the first stage in implementing PF. Yield maps are produced by processing data 
							from an adapted combine that has a vehicle positioning system integrated with a yield recording system. Massey Ferguson 
							was the first company to produce a commercial yield mapping combine.<br>

							This combine has a differential GPS fitted to it that can be identified by the GPS receiver on the roof of the cab and 
							the differential aerial above the engine.<br>

							The output from the combine is a data file that recorded every 1.2 seconds the position of the combine in longitude and 
							latitude, with the yield at that point. This data set can then be processed by various geo-statistical techniques into 
							a yield map.<br><br>

							<strong><i>Diagnosis and recommendation integrated system (DRIS)</i></strong><br>

							DRIS represents a holistic approach to the mineral nutrition of crop and has an impact on the integrated set of norms 
							representing calibration of plant tissues, soil composition, environmental parameters and farming practices as the 
							functions of the yield of a crop.<br>

							Once such norms are developed, it is possible to make a diagnosis of the conditions of the crop thereby isolating the
							factors, which are likely to be responsible for limiting the growth and production.<br>

							The most important advantages of DRIS approach are its ability to make a diagnosis at any stage of crop development and
							to list the nutrient in the order of importance, which are responsible for limiting the yield.<br><br>

							<strong>Future strategy </strong><br><br>

							Future strategy for adoption of precision agriculture in India should consider the problem of land fragmentation, lack 
							of highly sophisticated technical centers for precision agriculture, specific software for precision agriculture, poor 
							economic condition of the farmers, etc.<br>

							Precision agriculture in small farms is that individual farms will be treated as if they were management zones within a
							field and that some centralised entity will provide information to the individual farmers on a co-operative basis.<br><br>

							The problem of high cost of positioning system for small fields can be solved by ‘dead reckoning system’. The dead reckoning
							system, suitable for small regularly shaped fields, relies on in-field markers, such as foam to maintain consistent application.
							This approach provided farmers with a robust and credible method for making decisions about spatial management of their fields.<br>

							Nature of crop and weed vary from zone to zone, country to country. So development of software and hardware for crop and 
							weeds of India, site specific tillage technique should be initiated.<br>

							If applied properly these will, then, be used for precision agriculture not only suitable for developed countries but also for
							developing countries. It has a wider impact in farm management through more efficient machinery management.<br>

			<p> The agricultural sector is the backbone of the economy, contributing approximately 33 percent of Kenya’s Gross Domestic 
						Product (GDP). The agriculture sector employs more than 40 percent of the total population and 70 percent of the 
						rural population. However, agricultural productivity has stagnated in recent years. Smallholder farmers and agricultural
						enterprises continue to face challenges growing their businesses and improving the quality of agricultural goods. 
						We work to enhance agriculture-led economic growth, improve nutrition outcomes, strengthen county government capacity,
						and build sustainable market systems through private sector engagement with self-reliant rural households.<br><br> 

						<strong>PROGRAM AREAS</strong><br><br>
						<strong><i>Increasing food security</i></strong><br>
							
						As part of the Feed the Future initiative, USAID brings partners together to address the root causes of hunger and poverty.
						We work to enhance food security and increase incomes through improving the competitiveness and diversity of agricultural
						market systems and livelihoods. The initiative focuses on four main value chains: dairy, livestock, horticulture, and staple 
						foods. We link farmers to markets and modern farming practices, improve quality and supply of agricultural inputs, increase
						access to financing, and promote private sector solutions. <br><br>

						<strong><i>Building resilience of vulnerable communities</i></strong><br><br>
							
						Feed the Future aims to reduce the need for recurrent humanitarian assistance by accelerating economic growth for vulnerable
						communities to be able to withstand shocks. Our programs focus on regions in Kenya that experience cyclic shocks, where livestock
						is central to the economy, and rainfall is increasingly sporadic. <br>USAID also helps pastoralists earn more money from their herds,
						prevents diseases through increased access to water and sanitation, and improves the management of drought-prone rangelands.
						Despite the presence of the COVID-19 pandemic, USAID activities continue to strengthen the self-reliance of vulnerable households 
						by supporting livelihood diversification, increasing access to animal health services, and increasing sustainable management
						of grazing areas. <br><br>

						The Horn of Africa crisis in 2011 changed USAID’s approach with a strategic shift to begin co-locating long-term development
						and humanitarian assistance investments to build household and systems level resilience to prepare for future climatic, conflict,
						and disease triggered shocks. We work at the community, county, and national level to prepare for climatic shocks like droughts
						and floods. At the local community level, we have supported communities to create action plans to guide their development priorities.
						At the county level, county governments have developed sector plans in rangelands and drought management, while at national level,
						we have worked with the National Drought Management Authority to develop its plan for drought risk management and ending drought

						<strong><i>Improving nutrition and access to clean water and sanitation</i></strong><br><br>
						Inadequate nutrition in children under age five stunts their growth and development. Undernutrition puts children at greater
						risk of dying from common infections, increases the frequency and severity of such infections, and delays recovery. We increase
						access to diverse and quality foods to improve the health of women and children. Diarrheal diseases are the third leading 
						cause of death in children under age five. Access to household WASH services affects nutritional status by reducing diarrheal
						and other infectious diseases, reducing parasitic infections, and reducing pathogenic environments that lead to gut malfunction
						and poor absorption of nutrients. However, only 62% of Kenyans have access to improved drinking water. Even fewer (29%) have 
						access to improved sanitation.<br><br>

						To maximize our efforts, USAID integrates water and sanitation programs with programs focused on nutrition, agriculture, and health.
						We partner with the government, the private sector, and civil society to strengthen the systems that ensure sufficient water and 
						sanitation service delivery to improve the health and well-being of Kenyans. We focus on market-driven approaches to increase
						access to water and sanitation services, while protecting watersheds and water resources. <br> <br>

						<strong><i>Private sector investment</i></strong><br><br>
						USAID aims to create an enabling business environment at all stages of the target value chain through expanded access to finance
						for farmers and agricultural enterprises, increasing private-sector investment and through policy dialogues at the national and 
						county levels. To support Kenya’s Journey to Self-Reliance, we work towards a more competitive, vibrant, and inclusive agricultural
						market system, especially for women and youth. We support new ideas and innovations that improve the productivity and incomes of
						smallholder farmers. We also expand access to finance for farmers, entrepreneurs, and businesses. We operate an innovative credit
						facility that works with local financial institutions to unlock capital, providing loans to under-served borrowers, such as rural 
						farmers and small and medium-sized businesses.<br>

			<p>With almost one in three farmers over the normal retirement age but only one in twenty farmers under the age of 35,
							the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine launched the Succession Farm Partnership initiative in 2017, to try and change
							the apparent reluctance to legally transfer lands to the next generation.<br><br>

							<strong>What are the objectives?</strong><br><br>

							The main aim is to encourage the transfer of farm assets while also providing security for the transferors, by allowing
							them to retain ownership of up to 20% of their farm assets.<br>

							The initiative allows for young farmers to become involved in the farm business with their parents and to integrate them into
							the management side of the farm business at an earlier stage.In order for farms to remain competitive, the partnership also 
							provides an opportunity to increase scale, maintain security of labour better work-life balance and enhanced safety on-farm. 
							It will also reduce rural isolation and improve the social demographics of Irish farms.<br><br>

							<strong> Benefits of joining a Succession Farm Partnership?</strong><br><br>


							• Define succession and inheritance plan: Under this initiative, both generations are aware of the succession partnership allows
							the successor to integrate themselves into the farm business with their parents.<br>

							• The partnership gives them responsibility and decision making powers and is an important step in the development of the young
							person as a farmer. It provides an ideal transition of the farm business from parent to child.<br>

							• All parties remain involved in the day-to-day running of the enterprise. Responsibilities are shared as outlined in the 
							partnership agreement. As the young farmer now has a share really get involved, take responsibility and develop the farm business.<br><br>

							<strong><i>Work-life balance </i></strong><br><br>

							Improved work-life balance can be achieved when there is additional labour, skills, new enthusiasm and expertise available on
							the farm. Workload can be scheduled and managed, and a rota completed so that all partners enjoy time off and can plan holidays 
							safe in the knowledge that the other partner is familiar with the running of the farm. The enhanced range of skills makes
							the partnership more capable and can lead to better decision making, as well as more timely and safer work practices. Any investments
							required can be shared to reduce the burden on individual partners.<br><br>
							
							<strong>Financial benefits </strong><br>
							Financial incentives include taxation benefits and Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) scheme benefits.<br><br>
							
							<strong><i>Taxation benefits include: </i></strong><br>
							
								~ Succession Farm Partnership tax credit <br>
								~ Income tax sharing <br>
								~ Stock relief tax <br><br>

								~ Young farmer schemes <br>
